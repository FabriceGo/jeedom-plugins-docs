If you have a problem, start by reading the latest plugin-related topics on [community]({{site.forum}}/tags/plugin-{{page.pluginId}}).

If despite this you do not find an answer to your question, do not hesitate to create a new topic, with the tag of the plugin ([plugin-{{page.pluginId}}]({{site.forum}}/tags/plugin-{{page.pluginId}})).

At a minimum, you will need to provide:

- a screenshot of the Jeedom health page
- all available plugin logs
- depending on the case, a screenshot of the error encountered, a screenshot of the configuration causing the problem...
